# CheatSheets
My personal cheatsheets for the command line program [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat).

These are intended to be used along side the
[community-sourced cheatsheets](https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets), and mainly focus on
uses of commands that I often encounter, rather than generic how-to's.
